The governing document will define why your organisation exists, what it intends to do and how it will do it.

It will also detail the purpose of your co-operative and its relationship both to its members and to the outside world.

Your governing document will contain information about all the practical matters related to how an organisation is run, including:

Its aims or objects and how they will be achieved;
Who the members are, how and why they can become members and how they meet and make decisions;
Whether there is a governing body, what it is called, how it is appointed and how it meets and makes decisions;
What happens to any surplus; and
What happens to assets when the organisation is sold, taken over or wound up.

Principle 1: Voluntary and Open Membership
A co-operative’s governing document must include a provision that clearly defines who its members are and their relationship with the co-operative.  Members are the owners of the co-operative and it must be voluntary - just because a person may be eligible to be a member of a particular co-operative doesn’t mean that they are required to become a member.  On the other hand if someone is eligible to be member, the co-operative must not create artificial barriers to them becoming a member.

Principle 2: Democratic Member Control
A co-operative’s governing document should include a provision that enable members to actively participate in the governance of the co-operative, typically through voting at general meetings on a one member one vote basis.

The co-operative’s governing document should include a provision that requires the majority of the governing body to be elected by and from the membership and mechanisms to hold the governing body to account when making key decisions about the business of the co‑operative.

The governing document should include a provision that sets out how any underlying assets will be dealt with in if it should wind up.  Typically, a common or co-ownership provision will be included.

Principle 3: Member Economic Participation
The co-operative’s governing document will include a provision that enables members to contribute to and control the capital of the co-operative.  Depending on the co-operative’s legal form, this may be through the holding of shares in the co-operative or by committing to a guarantee in the event the co-operative should wind up with outstanding debts.

Principle 4: Autonomy and Independence
Depending on the legal form, a co-operative must have more than one member, which may be individuals or organisations, or a combination of the two.

The governing document should include a provision that limits the rate of interest paid on money borrowed from members and other financial institutions.

Principle 5: Education, Training and Information
The co-operative’s governing document should reflect a commitment to educate and train its members about the values and principle of co-operation, what it means to be a member of their co-operative and provide the required training to enable them to actively participate as member of the co-operative.

The co-operative’s governing document should reflect a commitment to educate and train its governing body about their role and responsibilities and provide the required training to enable them to be an effective Board of their co-operative.

Principle 6: Co-operation among Co-operatives
The co-operative’s governing document should include provisions for what it will do with its surplus assets upon winding up, including the possibility that any assets may be transferred to another co-operative or to the Co-operative Movement. Often this Principle may only be mentioned in the governing document as an intention or something to aspire to once the co-operative is trading successfully.

Principle 7: Concern for Community
The co-operative’s governing document should set out the defined community it will benefit.  This may be a community of interest, a geographical community or society more widely.

Collective or committee management?
In smaller co-operative organisations, where all members are also members of the governing body, the strategic decision-making is typically undertaken by meetings of the entire membership. This style of collective management becomes harder as the size of the membership increases. Organisations with more than 12 to 15 members often move towards committee management, where the members elect a smaller governing body and delegate some of their powers to it.


Constituency governance
Multi-stakeholder co-operatives that bring together different interest groups may choose to have “constituencies” or different “classes” of members. Some multi-stakeholder co-operatives have weighted voting or preserved places on the governing body for each class to ensure a balance between the different interests. Others rely upon the mutual aims of the members of the co-operative to ensure all interests are taken into account by the governing body who are elected on a simple one-member one-vote basis across the whole membership, for example, in a leisure trust.

Some co-operatives who organise themselves into departments or teams have chosen to ensure there are representatives of each team or department on their governing body.  This is often referred to as a “hub and spoke” model of governance.

Ex-officio
The governing body may include ex-officio members, whereby an individual is entitled to a position on the governing body by virtue of the position they hold. For example, the members of a community co-operative may want their General Manager to have a place on the governing body.

Independent Directors
Co-operatives can choose to co-opt independent directors onto their governing body where particular expertise or skills are required.  This can help to ensure a balanced board and also to fill skills gaps.
